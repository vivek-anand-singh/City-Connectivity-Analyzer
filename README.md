## 📖 Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Add Intersections**: Use the sidebar to add intersections (nodes) like A, B, C, etc.
2. **Connect Roads**: Add roads (edges) between intersections
3. **Analyze Network**: Use the tabs to explore different aspects of your network
4. **Load Sample Data**: Click "Load Sample City" to see a pre-built example

### Example Workflow

**Building a Simple City**:
1. Add intersections: A, B, C, D
2. Connect roads: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-A
3. Check connectivity: Should be fully connected
4. Find path: A to C (should be A → B → C)
5. Detect cycles: Should find the cycle A → B → C → D → A

## 🧮 Algorithms Explained

### Connectivity Check (DFS)
- **Purpose**: Determine if all intersections are reachable from each other
- **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search from any starting point
- **Result**: "Connected" if all nodes are visited, "Not Connected" otherwise

### Path Finding (BFS)
- **Purpose**: Find shortest path between two intersections
- **Algorithm**: Breadth-First Search with path tracking
- **Result**: List of intersections forming the shortest route

### Cycle Detection (DFS with Parent Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Identify if the network contains cycles
- **Algorithm**: DFS with parent node tracking to detect back edges
- **Result**: "Has Cycles" or "No Cycles"

### Dead End Detection (Degree Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Find intersections with only one connection
- **Algorithm**: Count connections (degree) for each node
- **Result**: List of nodes with degree = 1

### Component Analysis (DFS)
- **Purpose**: Identify disconnected parts of the network
- **Algorithm**: Multiple DFS runs to find all connected components
- **Result**: Number and composition of connected components

## 📊 Key Metrics

The application tracks several important network properties:

- **Total Intersections**: Number of nodes in the network
- **Total Roads**: Number of edges in the network
- **Network Density**: Ratio of actual edges to possible edges
- **Average Connections**: Average degree of all intersections
- **Dead Ends**: Number of intersections with only one connection
- **Connected Components**: Number of disconnected parts
- **Connectivity Status**: Whether the network is fully connected
- **Cycle Status**: Whether the network contains cycles
